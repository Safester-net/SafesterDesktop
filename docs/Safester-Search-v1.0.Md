See Desktop software for behavior.

But there will be only 2 folders Inbox, Outbox (no Draft for the moment) on Mobile.

## Symbolic Search Interface 

```
[Find                      ]

Search in: [Sender         ] 
                             
Messages sent between: 
[now - 1 month] and [today ]

Folder: [Inbox             ]
```



("Find" text is in light black, as "Name" in Register)

"Search In" is a drop-down with possible values:

- Inbox
- Sent.

Default Search In Folder is automatically set depending on from what screen search is called from. Default is Inbox.

Dates *should* be displayed as on Desktop with default locale, as possible.



## Search API & Search Algorithm

Todo asap.
