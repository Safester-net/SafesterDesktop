<li>New: Install page provides now a clean & state of the art Mac OS X installer.</li>
<li>New: (Security) Keys are now signed by a OpenPGP Masterkey stored on Server. 
    A Message send from client software is not allowed if the recipient key's signature verification fails.
    This means we are sure that the recipients keys are always those stored on the Server.<br>
    So, it's impossible for an attaquant to replace a public key by his own key in order to decrypt messages.
    Aka, when Alice sends an email to Bob, Alice is sure that Bob's key is guenine.
    If an attaquant Malory succeeds (after server hack) replacing Bob key by his own key,
    software will detect it because the forged key signature would be invalid.
   <br>In summary: if worst case scenario happens (server is hacked and controled by attaquants), attaquants
    won't be able either to decrypt messages, either to intercept messages after a man-in-the-middle attack. </li>
