The passphrase is used to protect your Safester account.
Please follow these guidelines to build a strong passphrase:
<ul>
<li>Use at least 13 characters; the more characters, the better (as long as you can remember them). 
You can use a very long passphrase!</li>

<li>Make your passphrase easy for you to remember but very hard for someone else to guess. 
Picking letters from a phrase that's meaningful to you may be the source for a good passphrase.</li> 

<li>Do not use personal information. Do not use words or acronyms that can be found in a dictionary.</li>

<li>Intersperse numbers, punctuation marks or symbols such as $, !, %, etc. </li>

<li>Always use a mixture of upper- and lower-case characters.</li>

<li>Never write down your passphrase; someone else might see it.</li>

<li>Select a unique passphrase. Do not use a password that you are using for some other purpose.</li>
