One Time Password (OTP) Authentication allows you to strongly authenticate yourself on Safester.
<br><br>
Safester has developed a partnership with In-Webo which provides strong Authentication services.
<br><br>
The principle of the solution is to identify you with a code, called authentication code that is generated
by an application on your phone, it is valid only once and for a limited period of time.
A new code is generated at each request.<br>
If someone intercepts the code you use, it can not connect with this code to your Safester account.
<br><br>
Once OTP Authentication is activated, when you want to login on Safester, you provide your login password
as usual, then you request an authentication code with your phone. You enter this code in Safester.

Click Next button to start the 3 steps wizard allowing you to activate OTP Authentication.<br>
This procedure will be executed only for the first OTP Authentication activation.
