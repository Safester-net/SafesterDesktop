<h2><font face="Arial" size=4>Composition of your message</h2>
<font face="Arial" size=4>

Compose and send your Safester message as you would do for any regular email:
<ul>
    <li>Add one or more recipients in the "To" or "Cc" zones. Just use existing email addresses like <a href="mailto:email@domain.net">email@domain.net</a>.</li>
    <br>
    <li>You may attach any kind of files to your message. You can drag & drop the files from your Desktop on the dedicated window.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Use the Rich Text Editor to compose the message body.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>"No Foward" Option</b>:
        <br>if selected (button pressed), recipients won't be able to forward the message with Safester.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>"No Print" Option</b>:
        <br>if selected, recipients won't be able to print the message.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>"Send Anonymous Notification" Option</b>:
        <br>recipients will be notified of your message in their regular email mailbox.
        if option is selected, the notification will be anonymous and your name and email won't appear.</li>
</ul>

<br>
The message body and the attached files will be encrypted on your PC and then uploaded to our secure Safester Server.
<br>
The encryption is done <i>before</i> the send, so no clear info will leave you PC.
<br>
<br>

<h2><font face="Arial" size=4>Delivery of your encrypted message</h2>
<font face="Arial" size=4>

The delivery depends on the Safester status of each recipient.
<ul>
    <li><b>If the recipient already has a Safester Account:</b>
        <br>he will receive a notification on his email address.
        <br>After login on his Safester Account, he will be able to decrypt and read your message and the attached files
        that will be safely decrypted on his PC.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>If the recipient has no Safester Account:</b> 
        <br>he will receive on his email address an invitation to create a free
        Safester Account.
        <br>Don't worry! The Account creation is completely <b><i>free</i></b> and available on all major Desktop OS
        (Windows, mac OS and Linux), Android and iOS.
        <br>The recipient will safely get and decrypt your encrypted message at first login.
        He will then be able to answer your message and send you back encrypted messages, again without any charge.</li>
</ul>
